# CSS Flexbox Methods

This repository contains a list of common CSS Flexbox methods along with brief descriptions and examples for each method.

## Introduction

CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a one-dimensional layout model that allows you to create flexible and efficient layouts for containers and their children. It provides a set of powerful methods for controlling the alignment, distribution, and ordering of flex items within a flex container.

## List of Methods

### 1. `display: flex`

Specifies a flex container.

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
}
2. flex-direction
Specifies the direction of the main axis in a flex container.

css

.flex-container {
  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;
}
3. justify-content
Aligns flex items along the main axis of the flex container.

css

.flex-container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;
}
4. align-items
Aligns flex items along the cross axis of the flex container.

css

.flex-container {
  align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline;
}
5. flex-grow
